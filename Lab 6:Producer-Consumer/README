6. a. Main.ccp - this contains c++ code for the main executing file. 
   b. Main.o - object file for Main.cpp
   c. Semaphore.cpp - c++ code for the implementation of Semaphores
   d. Semaphore.h   - c++ for the Semaphore header file
   e. makefile - makefile code for the project
   f. excecutable - the generated executable file for the project
